  <h1>SnapStudy Privacy Policy</h1>
  <div class="updated">Last updated: 2026-01-09</div>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how this application ("the App", "we", "us") collects,
    uses, and protects your information.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h2>1.1 Content You Provide</h2>
  <p>
    We may collect the following content that you voluntarily provide when using the App:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos (e.g. textbook images)</li>
    <li>Audio recordings (e.g. lecture recordings)</li>
    <li>Text input related to summaries or practice exams</li>
    <li>File titles and metadata you create within the App</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This content is used solely to provide AI-powered features such as summaries,
    learning materials, and practice exams.
  </p>

  <h2>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h2>
  <p>
    We may automatically collect limited technical information necessary to operate the App, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    <li>App version</li>
    <li>Anonymous usage data (e.g. feature usage, error logs)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information does not directly identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>Your information is used for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To generate summaries, learning content, and practice exams</li>
    <li>To process photos (OCR) and audio (speech-to-text)</li>
    <li>To store your saved recordings and generated results on your device</li>
    <li>To improve app performance and reliability</li>
    <li>To diagnose errors and prevent abuse</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not use your content for advertising or profiling.
  </p>

  <h2>3. AI & Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    To provide core functionality, the App uses third-party AI services, which may process
    your content temporarily:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</li>
    <li>Speech-to-Text (audio transcription)</li>
    <li>AI-generated summaries and exam questions</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These services process data only to perform the requested task and do not receive your identity.
    We do not allow third-party providers to use your data for their own purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos and audio recordings are stored locally on your device unless explicitly uploaded for processing.</li>
    <li>Generated summaries and exams may be stored locally for history access.</li>
    <li>Temporary processing data may be stored briefly on secure servers and deleted after processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You can delete your content at any time within the App.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties, except:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When required to provide core AI functionality</li>
    <li>When required by law or legal process</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Secure transmission (HTTPS)</li>
    <li>Limited access to processing systems</li>
    <li>Separation between user identity and content</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    However, no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is designed for educational use.
    We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13
    without parental consent.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the right to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your data</li>
    <li>Delete your data</li>
    <li>Stop using the App at any time</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Most data can be deleted directly within the App.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
    Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last updated" date.
